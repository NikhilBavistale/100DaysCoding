Task
We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:
(a+2^0.b),(a+2^0.b+2^1.b),....,(a+2^0.b+2^1.b+...+2^(n-1).b)
You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n.
For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai, bi, and ni values for that query.

Output Format
For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of n space-separated integers.
