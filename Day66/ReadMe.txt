If B<=0 or H<=0 , the output should be "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.

Input Format

There are two lines of input. The first line contains B: the breadth of the parallelogram.
The next line contains H: the height of the parallelogram.

Output Format

If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output the area of the parallelogram.
Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.
