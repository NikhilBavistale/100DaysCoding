Task
Write the following declarations and implementations:
  Two instance variables: one for your stack, and one for your queue.
  A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
  A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the queue instance variable.
  A char popCharacter() method that pops and returns the character at the top of the stack instance variable.
  A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeues and returns the first character in the queue instance variable.

Input Format
You do not need to read anything from stdin.
The locked stub code in your editor reads a single line containing string s. 
It then calls the methods specified above to pass each character to your instance variables.

Output Format
You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout.
If your code is correctly written and s is a palindrome, the locked stub code will print The word, s, is a palindrome.; 
otherwise, it will print The word, s, is not a palindrome.
