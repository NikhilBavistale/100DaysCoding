Tree Traversal

Aim
Implementing tree traversal using In Order Method

Input
Root, Left SubTree and Right SubTree

Output
Inorder traversal of tree.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: If we donâ€™t consider the size of the stack for function calls then O(1) otherwise O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
