Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.
Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S.

Output Format

For each String Sj (where 0<=j<=T-1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sj's odd-indexed characters.
