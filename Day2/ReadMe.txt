Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Pseudocode
Bubble_Sort(A)
1.	For i=0 to A.length-2
2.	  For j=A.length-1 to i+1
3.	    If A[j]<A[j-1]
4.	      Swap(A[j],A[j-1])

Input Array
No of elements-6
5,4,7,9,6,3

Output
3,4,5,6,7,9
