Aim
To write a program to implement Worst fit algorithm for memory management.

Explanation
In the worst fit, allocate the largest available hole to process. 
This method produces the largest leftover hole. 
In this allocation technique, the process traverses the whole memory and always search for the largest hole/partition, 
and then the process is placed in that hole/partition. 
It is a slow process because it has to traverse the entire memory to search the largest hole. 

Input
Enter the number of unallocated space  4
Enter the allocated memory space
45  23  10  50
The memory space required for the given process   40

Output
worst fit of the given process is  50
