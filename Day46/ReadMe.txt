Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the __elements instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in __elements and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.

Input Format
You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. 
The locked Solution class in the editor reads in 2 lines of input.
The first line contains N, the size of the elements array.
The second line has  space-separated integers that describe the __elements array.

Output Format
You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the maximumDifference instance variable.
